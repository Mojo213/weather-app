#Weather App Project 

Project Overview
This project is a simple weather application that fetches real-time weather data from the WeatherAPI.com API based on user-provided location input. The application displays various weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and more. Additionally, it dynamically updates the background image based on the current weather condition fetched from the API. Users can also toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.

Skills Demonstrated
JavaScript (ES6+):

Asynchronous JavaScript: Utilized async/await for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from the API.
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically created and updated HTML elements to display weather data.
Event Handling: Implemented event listeners to trigger actions based on user interactions, such as button clicks.
Conditional Statements and Switch Case: Used conditional logic to determine the appropriate background image based on weather conditions.
API Integration:

Utilized the WeatherAPI.com API to fetch real-time weather data based on user-provided location input.
CSS Styling:

Implemented CSS styling to create a visually appealing user interface.
Used CSS Flexbox for layout positioning and alignment.
Ensured responsiveness across different screen sizes.
Error Handling:

Implemented error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where the API request fails or returns an error response.
Linting:

Used ESLint for code linting to maintain code quality and adhere to coding standards.

Future Enhancements

Implement geolocation functionality to automatically fetch weather data based on the user's current location.

Add support for displaying weather forecasts for the next few days.

Enhance error handling and user feedback.
